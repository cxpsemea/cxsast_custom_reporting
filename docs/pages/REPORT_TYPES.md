# Report types

There are currently two different report types that can be used:

#### [ScanSummary](REPORT_TYPES_SCAN_SUMMARY)

The simplest one. This kind of report provides some relevant information giving the users a overview of the current status/state of a specified project.

#### [Consolidated](REPORT_TYPES_SCAN_CONSOLIDATED)

This report type gives the possibility to associate multiple projects and consolidate all the data in one single report. This can be very usefull when an application is composed by multiple projects and the users want to get a overview of all the application status/state and not separated projects data.

NOTE: This type of report was required because right now on CxSAST there is no way to associate multiple projects.
